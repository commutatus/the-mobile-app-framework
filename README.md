# Welcome,
This project aims to serve as complete guide for hybrid app development through either React Native or Flutter.

## How is the framework categorized?
To make things simpler and easily accessible, We've divided the framework into the following stages:

   1. [Pre-Development Stage](Pre-Development%20Stage/README.md)
   2. [Development Stage](Development%20Stage/README.md)
   3. [Post-Development Stage](Post-Development%20Stage/README.md)

Each of these stages are further divided into smaller steps in a chronological order of how things should be.

## Why does this framework exist?
We never found a single consolidated place of knowledge that would tell me everything that we needed to know when we started Hybrid App Development.  
  
  Now, with a collective experience of a few years behind us, we aim to create such a resource which contains everything that right from a beginner to an advanced developer might need.

## Can I contribute to make it better?
Sure. This framework might not hold up to the upcoming standards with technological advancements.  
Any suggestions/updates are welcomed and can be made by opening a PR.
