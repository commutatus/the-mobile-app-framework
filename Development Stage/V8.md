# Replacing the JSCore engine with Google's V8 engine

**Note:** This only works for Android. iOS continues to use JSCore as it is primarily supported by their OS.

1. Much better RAM utilization on Android.
2. Better Garbage collection.
3. This translates to the app being smoother and faster than before. 

Optionally you can use Hermes too if required.
